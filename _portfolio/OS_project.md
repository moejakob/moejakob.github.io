## Introduction
Year after year, new scientific discoveries have an impact on people all over the world. Such discoveries may have farreaching consqeuences. For example, they might be the basis for major political policies or for medical treatment procedures all over the world. With scientific research having such strong societal impact, it is pertinent that people all over the planet have equal access to scientific discoveries. One major step towards achieving this goal is to publish research results as Open Access (OA), i.e. to make it freely available for everyone.

Every year, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) Leiden publishes a ranking that among other information includes some statistics on the OA publishing practices of universities world wide. In this project I worked with data from the [CWTS Leiden Ranking OPEN Edition 2023](https://open.leidenranking.com/).

## Exploring Open Access Practices
Open Access has gained a lot of momentum in recent years. As a matter of fact, the overall worldwide open access publication rate (blue line has risen from 28.2% during the period of 2006-2009 to 55.1% during the most recently assessed period (2018-2021). It is notable, that opan access conventions differ between subject areas. In particular, OA rates in the Biomedichal and Health Sciences (orange line) have consistently been higher than in other fields. A reason for those high OA rates may be that this area of research can be viewed being of especially high importance as it can literally decide over life and death.

Additionally, OA practices also vary quite strongly by regions. In the map below I have marked the 100 universities with the highes OA rates world wide in the period 2018-2021. It is very notable that only 7 of these 100 universities are outside of Europe (3 in the USA, 2 in Africa and 2 in the Middle East). If we look more closely, we can even see that 69 of the top 100 OA universities are located in only two European countries (58 in the UK and 11 in the Netherlands).

Open Access is often subcategorised into different *colours*. While all articles that are published in any type of OA can be accessed for free, most major publishers have adapted models (**Gold OA** and **Hybrid OA**) that require publication fees from researchers that want to publish their work as an OA article. Other models like **Green OA** and **Bronze OA** don't require publication fees. When we look at the development of OA publication rates by OA colours, we notice that the increase in OA rates is largely driven by **Gold** and **Hybrid Open Access** publications - the two models that require payment from researchers. Since research funding varies from region to region, it is not unexpected that OA practices are mostly centered around Europe rather than poorer countries. I will go into more details about this issue and about the different OA models in a blog post soon.
