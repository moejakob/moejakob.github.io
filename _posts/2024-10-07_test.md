This is the beginning of my journey to become a data professional. Coming from a background in linguistics, I know I have some way to go to achieve this goal but I also know that by working hard and following my interests, I can achieve this goal.<br>
## Is data science the answer to all problems?

With technology rapidly advancing and computer usage taking up more and more of our dayily routine, we're confronted with many new problems (which browser should I use in order to minimise tracking of my data?) but also with some familiar problems that can be solved in new ways (like where am I going to get my take-out today?). It is tempting to think that data science is always the answer, but is it?ðŸ¤”

Let's assume I want to order dinner but I'm undecided from which restaurant. I open the delivery app on my phone and the restaurant with the highest rating is *Sakana Sushi Palace* - 5/5 stars, 2354 ratings (the most of any restaurant on the app!). Had I employed a **bad** data scientist to help me with this decision, they would probably recommend I ordered from *Sakana Sushi Palace* because it is clearly the best restaurant in town. Good right? Wrong! Because I **reeeaally** don't like Sushi. So basing this decision purely on data would have led to me chucking my food-order in the bin.

So no. Data science is not the answer to all problems. Some problems (like the "really hard" one in the comic) are extremely complex and just using algorithms may not be enough to solve them. To solve other problems (like my dinner decision) we may just lack essential information (or ehem... data). But just because we may not be able to solve these issues by using data alone, that doesn't mean that data may support us in solving them.

## Reasons why I want to work with data ðŸ“Š

**Numbers don't lie (but by themselves they also don't tell the whole truth):** solid data helps us make decisions because it reflects opinions and facts from our society. Yet, though it may seem at first that data professionals only analyse numbers, my strongest asset for this job would be my sociological sensitivity to stakeholders.

**Data explains the world:** It's like a superpower to me - one previously reserved for physicistsðŸ˜‰ but in todays world (almost) everything can be explained by analysing and interpreting the underlying data - if you know how.

**It never gets boring:** I'm curious by nature. I always find at least something interesting in any topic. In some topics (like language or trailrunning) more than in others. Today, pretty much every single industry includes data that people want analysed. The prospect of working in such a diverse job is a big draw for me.

However, despite the high demand for data professionals, transitioning to this career isnâ€™t easy for me so I want to present you with some challenges I face:

## Challenges in becoming a data professional
![thinking](/images/2024-09-09_blogpost/thinking.jpeg 'Hmmm')

**Knowing where to begin:** this is probably the biggest challenge. When you're considering a career change, it is always hard to know where to begin. On the one hand, it is quite lucky that we can find **so much** information on the internet. On the other hand, all of that different information can be quite daunting for someone new to a field. Luckily, I feel that I am now on the right track to achieve my goal of becoming a data professional.

**Deciding on which job I want to have:** and here I'm not just referring to which company I want to work for. When I look through job advertisements, I see companies looking for data scientists, data analysts, (big) data engineers, data managers, and data architects. Then there is ads looking for machine learning specialists, business intelligence analysts, statisticians... the list goes on. Honestly, I'm still figuring out what kind of data professional I want to be. However, to be fair, I think most employers are also still trying to define, what they need/want in a data professional.

**Developing the right skillset:** there are hundreds (if not thousands) of programming languages and tools that one could use to work with data and choosing where to focus is challenging.

**Will AI takeover my job once I made it ðŸ¤–?** Yes, LLMs are extremely good at some tasks (e.g. coding) but I think I already made clear that some uniquely human skills are essential, so I'm really not too worried about this.

## Steps I'm taking to become a data professional
As a trained phonetician I am familiar with using data to analyse speech but for most companies, that might not be enough. By looking through (many) job ads, I identified a set of key skills which I'm currently honing, including:

**Analysing real world data:** this includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualisation and some classification/predictive modeling. From my time as a researcher, I already have a good amount of experience using R to do these things. Currently, I am focusing on brushing up on my Python skills for these tasks as well. Furthermore, on September 16th, I will start a course to learn to create visualisation-dashboards with Microsoft PowerBI.

**Database management:** Database management is essential when working with data. Competently using SQL is a skill I have yet to master - and I will do so in the same course mentioned above.

**Data storytelling:** this skill is essential for a effective collaboration. Like all other competences I mentioned here, you can only improve this one with practice, which is why I currently use real world datasets (e.g. from Kaggle) to complete data analysis and improve my narrative skills.

## What's next?
Iâ€™ll continue to work on data projects and present them here. My first project, on open science practices at different universities, will be featured in a post next week.

Until then,
Moritz
