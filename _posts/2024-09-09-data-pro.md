This is the beginning of my journey to become a data professional. While I know that coming from a background in linguistics, I have some way to go to achieve this goal, I also know that by working hard and following my interests, I can achieve this goal.<br><br>In this first post I want to talk about my motivations, where my interest in data roots and how I plan to fulfil my dream of working as a data professional.<br>
### Is data science the answer to all problems?

With technology rapidly advancing and computer usage taking up more and more of our dayily routine, we're confronted with many new problems (which browser should I use in order to minimise tracking of my data?) but also with some familiar problems that can be solved in new ways (like where am I going to get my take-out today?). It is tempting to think that using data science to solve these problems born from digitalisation - but would that really make sense?

Let's assume I want to order dinner but I'm undecided from which restaurant. I open the delivery app on my phone and the restaurant with the highest rating is *Sakana Sushi Palace* - 5/5 stars, 2354 ratings (the most of any restaurant on the app!). Had I employed a poor data scientist to help me with this decision, they would probably recommend me to order from *Sakana Sushi Palace* because it is clearly the best restaurant in my town. Good right? Wrong! Because I **reeeaally** don't like Sushi. So basing this decision purely on data would have led to me chucking my food-order in the bin.

So no. Data science is not the answer to all problems. Some problems (like the "really hard" one in the comic) are extremely complex and just using algorithms may not be enough to solve them. To solve other problems (like my dinner decision) we may just lack essential information (or ehem... data). But just because we may not be able to solve these issues purely using data, that doesn't mean that data may support us in solving them.

### Reasons why I want to work with data

**Numbers don't lie (but by themselves they also don't tell the whole truth):** solid data can really help us to make our decisions because they reflect opinions and facts from our society. But as seen in the example above, we need to interpret them in a way that takes all variables into account. Even though it may seem at first that data professionals only analyse numbers, my strongest asset for this job would be my sociological sensitivity to stakeholders.

**Data explains the world:** this is kind of like a superpower to me and while this superpower was previously reserved for physicistsðŸ˜‰, in todays world (almost) everything can be explained by analysing and interpreting the underlying data.

**It never gets boring:** I like to think of my self as a pretty curious person. So far I have always been able to find at least something interesting in any topic. In some topics (like language or trailrunning) more than in others. Today, pretty much every single industry has some related data that people want analysed. The prospect of working in such a diverse job has a really strong appeal to me.

Even though data professionals are one of the most sought after jobs at the moment, I can't just snap my finger to get one of them. It's just not that easy so here are some of the challenges this career change brings with it.

### Challenges in becoming a data professional
**Knowing where to begin:** this is probably the biggest challenge. When you're considering a career change, it is always hard to know where to begin. On the one hand, it is quite lucky that we can find **so much** information on the internet. On the other hand, all of that different information can be quite daunting for someone new to a field. Luckily, I feel that I am now on the right track to achieve my goal of becoming a data professional (see more in the next paragraph).

**Deciding on which job I want to have:** and here I'm not just referring to which company I want to work for. When you look through job advertisements, there is jobs for data scientists, data analysts, (big) data engineers, data managers, data quality analysts and data architects. Then there is ads looking for machine learning specialists, business intelligence analysts, statisticians and a whole bunch of other job titles. If you're still reading this, you may have noticed that I keep referring to my goal as becoming a data professional and to be honest with you, the reason for that is that I'm still trying to figure out, what kind of data practicioner I really want to be. However, to be fair, I think most employers are also still trying to figure out, what kind of data professional they need/want.

**Developing the right skillset:** there are hundreds (if not thousands) of programming languages that you could use to work with your data. Sure some might be more popular than others but I still need to make hard decisions here about where to focus my training.

**Will AI takeover my job once I made it?** So yes, LLMs are extremely good at some things (e.g. coding) but I think I already made clear that I think it's essential to have some skills that are unique to being a human, so I'm really not too worried about this.

### Steps I'm taking to become a data professional
I am a trained phonetician (or speech scientist). So I already know (quite well) how to use data to analyse speech. But for most companies, that might not be enough. By looking through (many) job ads, I identified a set of key skills that I think should be part of the tech-stack of a data professional. At the moment, I am developing an expertise in the following competences:

**Analysing real world data:** this includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualisation and some classification/predictive modeling. From my time as a researcher, I already have a good amount of experience using the statistical package R to do these things. Currently, I am focusing on brushing up on my Python skills for these tasks as well. Furthermore, on 16^th September, I will start a course to learn to create visualisation-dashboards with Microsoft PowerBI.

**Database management:** the best option to store and manage data efficiently is by using databases. Competently using SQL is a skill I have yet to master - and starting on the 16^th September, I will do so in the same course that will teach me about visualisation-dashboards.

**Data storytelling:** or how to best present your data in an interesting way following a clear narrative. This skill is essential for a fruitful collaboration between all parties. Like all other competences I mentioned here, you can only improve this one with practice, which is why I currently use real world datasets (e.g. from Kaggle datasets) to complete data analysis projects.

### What's next?
Well I already mentioned that I will soon start a course to extend my skillset. In the meantime (and during the 8 weeks of the course) I will continue to work on data-projects that I will present here in this blog.

I will present the first one (about open science practices at different universities) in a blog post next week.

Until then,
Moritz
