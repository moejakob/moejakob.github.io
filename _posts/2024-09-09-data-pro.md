This is the beginning of my journey to become a data professional. While I know that coming from a background in linguistics, I have some way to go to achieve this goal, I also know that by working hard and following my interests, I can achieve this goal.<br><br>In this first post I want to talk about my motivations, where my interest in data roots and how I plan to fulfil my dream of working as a data professional.<br>
### Is data science the answer to all problems?

With technology rapidly advancing and computer usage taking up more and more of our dayily routine, we're confronted with many new problems (which browser should I use in order to minimise tracking of my data?) but also with some familiar problems that can be solved in new ways (like where am I going to get my take-out today?). It is tempting to think that using data science to solve these problems born from digitalisation - but would that really make sense?<br><br>

Let's assume I want to order dinner but I'm undecided from which restaurant. I open the delivery app on my phone and the restaurant with the highest rating is *Sakana Sushi Palace* - 5/5 stars, 2354 ratings (the most of any restaurant on the app!). Had I employed a poor data scientist to help me with this decision, they would probably recommend me to order from *Sakana Sushi Palace* because it is clearly the best restaurant in my town. Good right? Wrong! Because I **reeeaally** don't like Sushi. So basing this decision purely on data would have led to me chucking my food-order in the bin.<br><br>

So no. Data science is not the answer to all problems. Some problems (like the "really hard" one in the comic) are extremely complex and just using algorithms may not be enough to solve them. To solve other problems (like my dinner decision) we may just lack essential information (or ehem... data). But just because we may not be able to solve these issues purely using data, that doesn't mean that data may support us in solving them.

### Reasons why I want to work with data

**Numbers don't lie (but by themselves they also don't tell the whole truth):** solid data can really help us to make our decisions because they reflect opinions and facts from our society. But as seen in the example above, we need to interpret them in a way that takes all variables into account. Even though it may seem at first that data professionals only analyse numbers, my strongest asset for this job would be my sociological sensitivity to stakeholders. <br><br>

**Data explains the world:** this is kind of like a superpower to me and while this superpower was previously reserved for physicistsðŸ˜‰, in todays world (almost) everything can be explained by analysing and interpreting the underlying data.<br><br>

**It never gets boring:** I like to think of my self as a pretty curious person. So far I have always been able to find at least something interesting in any topic. In some topics (like language or trailrunning) more than in others. Today, pretty much every single industry has some related data that people want analysed. The prospect of working in such a diverse job has a really strong appeal to me.<br><br>



### Challenges in becoming a data professional
- knowing where to begin
- deciding on which job I want to have
- developing the right skillset
- keeping up with evolving technologies
- will AI takeover my job once I made it?
