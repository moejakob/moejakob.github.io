# About Me
Hello! I'm Moritz, an aspiring data professional based in Konstanz, Germany. I have a background in phonetics and computational linguistics, two strongly data-driven social sciences. Working on these topics in a research environment allowed me to build a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical methods and programming languages like Python and R and using these skills to uncover trends and patterns in empirical data. Additionally, working as a staff member of the University of Konstanz' Team Open Science I developed a strong passion for transparancy and openness in data management. I am eager to apply these skills to make data-driven decisions and to solve real-world problems by contributing to impactful problems. Digital data holds many possibilities and I am excited to explore how we can use it to drive innovation together!
